The aim of this view is to formulate and evaluate a cost curve for the biomass price as a function of the demand vs supply of biomass on a European scale. The cost curve should be almost constantly equal to 1 and then start increasing significantly once e.g. 50 % of the available resource is used. A curve could look something like:|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|(0%,1)-(40%,1)-(50%,1.1)-(60%,1.3)-(70%,1.6)-(80%,2.2)-(90%,3.0)-(95%,5.0)-(100%,10.0)-(110%,20.0).|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|The used biomass price likely has some of these dynamics assumed as well exogenously.
