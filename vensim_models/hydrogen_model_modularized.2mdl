The aim of this view is to formulate and evaluate a cost curve for the biomass price as a function of the demand vs supply of biomass on a European scale. The cost curve should be almost constantly equal to 1 and then start increasing significantly once e.g. 50 % of the available resource is used. A curve could look something like:|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|(0%,1)-(40%,1)-(50%,1.1)-(60%,1.3)-(70%,1.6)-(80%,2.2)-(90%,3.0)-(95%,5.0)-(100%,10.0)-(110%,20.0).|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|The used biomass price likely has some of these dynamics assumed as well exogenously.

From EHB (https://www.ehb.eu/files/downloads/EHB-Analysing-the-future-demand-supply-and-transport-of-hydrogen-June-2021-v3.pdf):|<<NnN>>|"This study therefore assumes an end-state in 2050 with an even three-way split|<<NnN>>|between the process decarbonisation options (cracking, methanol-to-olefins and|<<NnN>>|conventional steam cracking with a decarbonised energy carrier) and the three|<<NnN>>|naphtha or methanol feedstock decarbonisation options (synthetic, bio-based and chemically recycled).|<<NnN>>|Hydrogen demand is forecasted at 67 TWh in 2030, 164 TWh in 2040 and 291 TWh. The hydrogen demand for the feedstock is assumed to be located at fuel production sites, as it is today and thus it is included in the fuel production section (see 2.1.4)."
