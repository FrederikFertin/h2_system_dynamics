The amount sailed in a year assumption is based on the new electric container ships sialing between Shanghai and Nanjing (distance 150 nm/day). They have an installed battery capacity of 50MWh, but with more battery capacity at each port for recharging. Assumption is that the voided consumption is 3900 kg HFO per 100 nautical miles sailed; This is then used to convert to energy usage.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|Storage needs are equivalent to the size of the batteries on the BE ship.

The aim of this view is to formulate and evaluate a cost curve for the biomass price as a function of the demand vs supply of biomass on a European scale. The cost curve should be almost constantly equal to 1 and then start increasing significantly once e.g. 50 % of the available resource is used. A curve could look something like:|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|(0%,1)-(40%,1)-(50%,1.1)-(60%,1.3)-(70%,1.6)-(80%,2.2)-(90%,3.0)-(95%,5.0)-(100%,10.0)-(110%,20.0)-(200%,100.0).|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|The used biomass price likely has some of these dynamics assumed as well exogenously.

Assuming the cost of the hulls of the ships are the same, the ships are divided into either battery or ICE propelled ships. All ICE ships operate with same efficiency and capital costs regardless of fuel. Battery driven ships operate with different capital costs (the battery and different motor) as well as a higher efficiency.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|Source: doi.org/10.1038/s41560-022-01065-y
