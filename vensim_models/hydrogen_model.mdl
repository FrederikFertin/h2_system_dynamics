Assuming the cost of the hulls of the ships are the same, the ships are divided into either battery or ICE propelled ships. All ICE ships operate with same efficiency and capital costs regardless of fuel. Battery driven ships operate with different capital costs (the battery and different motor) as well as a higher efficiency.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|Source: doi.org/10.1038/s41560-022-01065-y

The aim of this view is to formulate and evaluate a cost curve for the biomass price as a function of the demand vs supply of biomass on a European scale. The cost curve should be almost constantly equal to 1 and then start increasing significantly once e.g. 50 % of the available resource is used. A curve could look something like:|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|(0%,1)-(40%,1)-(50%,1.1)-(60%,1.3)-(70%,1.6)-(80%,2.2)-(90%,3.0)-(95%,5.0)-(100%,10.0)-(110%,20.0)-(200%,100.0).|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|The used biomass price likely has some of these dynamics assumed as well exogenously.

The hydrogen demand for the feedstock is assumed to be located at fuel production sites, as it is today and thus it is included in the fuel production section (see 2.1.4)."|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|This paper explains the core concepts of the plastic production process and highlights where potentials for CO2 emissions reductions are:|<<NnN>>|https://think.ing.com/articles/how-the-plastics-industry-can-go-green-and-at-what-cost/
